<p>I am a full stack Ruby on Rails developer that graduated from Ho Chi Minh University of Technology specializing Computer Science. I have been working with Rails for 3 years and getting through over 10 projects, ranging from educational, banking to real estate websites. My experience includes building fast, reliable, responsive websites combining both front-end skills (HTML, CSS, Javascript, template engines...) and Rails backend skills. I usually use my free time for some self-training projects to learn new techniques and sharpen my coding skills.</p>
